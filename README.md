 # DOCKER DOCUMENTATION  

In this documentation we covers basics of `Docker` like setup, images, containers, networking, volumes, security, and advanced concepts for efficient containerization practices.

# What is Docker?

* ```Docker``` is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It uses containerization technology to package software and its dependencies into standardized units called containers. These containers can run on any machine, providing consistency across environments and simplifying the deployment process for developers and system administrators.
* ```Docker``` is an open source software program or a service to manage containers, it enables us to create, run and execute softwares virtually without installing any other operating system. In short docker is an ecosystem where we can create and run containers.
* Docker is a service which contains containers . it is derived for developers to develop, to run and execute applications. There is no need to install multiple operating systems. Also, docker is very flexible to work.

# Why use Docker?

> Clean & Separate:

Run each app in its own space, like having separate rooms for different tasks. This keeps things organized and avoids conflicts.

> Move Anywhere:

Imagine our apps in portable boxes. Docker lets move our apps easily between different computers or cloud services, like packing boxes for a move.

> Runs Fast & Lean:

Containers are lightweight, like carrying a backpack instead of a suitcase. They start up quicker and use fewer resources.

> Always the Same:

 Build our app recipe once with Docker. No matter where i run it, I get the same results, avoiding setup headaches.

> Share and Colaborate:

Easily share our apps with others. They can run them without needing the same setup you have, like sharing a recipe with friends.

# Key Features of Docker:

## Containerization:

> Containerization in ```Docker``` is like packing our software and all its stuff into a virtual box, called a container. It keeps everything tidy and separate from the rest of our computer, so our programs run smoothly without messing with each other. It's like having a mini world for each application.

<br>

## Portability:

> `Docker` containers can run on any machine that supports Docker, Making it easy to deploy application across various platforms, from development to production. 

<br>

## Efficiency:

> `Docker` uses resourcess more eficiently than traditional virtual machines, as containers share the host system's kernel and do not require a full opearating system.

<br>

## Scalability:

> `Docker` makes it easy to scale applications by quickly deploying additional containers to handle increased demand.

<br>

## Modularity:

> `Docker` promotes a modular approach to software development, where applications are broken down into smaller. Manageable components that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.

<br>

 ## Developer Productivity:

> With the help of `docker`, Developer can build, test, and deploy applications more quicly and reliablly, thanks to the ability to create lightweight, reproducible development enviroments.

# Docker Architecture

* Docker uses Client-Server architecture, which involves the 3 main components that are Docker Client, Docker Host, and Docker Registry. The Docker client communicates with the Docker daemon, which takes care of the building, running, and distributing the Docker containers. The Docker client and daemon can run on the same system or connect a client to a remote Docker daemon. They communicate using REST APIs, over UNIX sockets or a network interface.
